    "lyrics": "My parents must have thought they had a crazy kid\n'Cause I was one of those kids who always knew what I wanted\nThey took me down to the airport to see all the planes departing\nWatching them fly something inside of me was starting\nI was eight when I told them that I'd be a pilot\n\nBut I was too young and too short\nand there were no female captains\nand my dad said, \"be patient\" he said, \"just see what happens\"\nBut I took my first lesson came down from the sky\nand told my father I'd fly for the rest of my life\n\nAnd I got my first job flying for a mortician\nin a tiny bonanza, just a corpse and me\nFive dollars an hour for flying dead bodies\nI had to climb over their faces just to get to my seat\n\nAnd suddenly the wheels lift off\nthe ground is falling backwards\nI am suddenly alive\n\nSuddenly I'm in the cockpit\nSuddenly everything's changed\nSuddenly I'm not too young or too short\nand the passengers in the back don't complain\n\nSuddenly I'm flying company charters\nSuddenly everything's high\nSuddenly there's nothing in between me and the sky\nAmerican Airlines had the prettiest planes\nSo I applied as a flight engineer\n\nBut the World War II pilots, they all complained\nThey said, \"girls shouldn't be in the cockpit\"\n\"Hey lady, hey baby, hey! Why don't you grab us a drink?\"\nAnd the flight attendants weren't my friends back then\nand they said, \"Are you better than us, do you think?\"\n\nBut I kept getting hired\nAnd the World War II crew, they retired\nAnd the girls all thought much higher of me\n1986 the first female American captain in history\n\nSuddenly I'm in the cockpit\nSuddenly I've got my wings\nSuddenly all of those pilots protested me\nWell, they can get their own drinks\n\nSuddenly there's no one saying, \"Stay grounded\"\nLooking down passing them by\nSuddenly there's nothing in between me and the sky\n\nSuddenly I've got an all female crew\nThe news talked, it made headlines across the world\nSuddenly it stopped\nNo one saying, \"You can't\" or \"You won't\"\nor \"You know you're not anything 'cause you're a girl\"\n\nSuddenly I'm getting married\nand we're putting pins on the map where we've flown\nSuddenly I am a mother\nand suddenly shocked at how much they've grown\n\nSuddenly I'm wondering how my parents would feel\nseeing me teaching men to be pilots\n'Cause suddenly I am a senior instructor\nand somehow I'm 51\n\nSuddenly I'm flying Paris to Dallas\nAcross The Atlantic and feeling calm\nWhen suddenly someone on air to air traffic says\n\"At 8:46 there's been a terrorist action\"\nAnd the one thing I loved more than anything\nwas used as the bomb\n\nSuddenly I'm in a hotel\nSuddenly something has died\nSuddenly there's something in between me and the sky\n",
