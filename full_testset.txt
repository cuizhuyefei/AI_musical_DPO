Do you wake up in the morning And need help to lift your head
Do you read obituaries And feel jealous of the dead
It's like living on a cliffside Not knowing when you'll dive
Do you know Do you know
What it's like to die alive

When a world that once had color Fades to white and grey and black
When tomorrow terrifies you But you'll die if you look back
You don't know
I know you don't know
You say that you're hurting It sure doesn't show

You don't know
It lays me so low
When you say let go And I say
You don't know

The sensation that you're screaming But you never make a sound
Or the feeling that you're falling But you never hit the ground
It just keeps on rushing at you Day by day by day by day
You don't know You don't know
What it's like to live that way

Like a refugee a fugitive Forever on the run
If it gets me it will kill me But I don't know what I've done

Thank you for the music
The songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy
They're bringing
Who can live without it I ask in all honesty 
What would life be

Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me

Mother says I was A dancer before I could walk
She says I began To sing long before I could talk
And I've often wondered How did it all start?
Who found out that nothing 
Can capture a heart Like a melody can?
Well who ever it was, I'm a fan

in sleep he sang to me
in dreams he came
that voice which calls to me and speaks my name

and do I dream again?
for now I find
the phantom of the opera is there
inside my mind

sing once again with me
our strange duet
my power over you
grows stronger yet

and though you turn from me
to glance behind
the phantom of the opera is there
inside your mind

those who have seen your face
draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear
it's me they hear

my spirit and my voice
in one combined
the phantom of the opera is there
inside my mind

Have you ever felt like nobody was there
Have you ever felt forgotten in the middle of nowhere
Have you ever felt like you could disappear
Like you could fall and no one would hear

Well, let that lonely feeling wash away
Maybe there's a reason to believe you'll be okay
Cause when you don't feel strong enough to stand
You can reach, reach out your hand

And oh, someone will come running
And I know they'll take you home

Even when the dark comes crashing through
When you need a friend to carry you
And when you're broken on the ground
You will be found

So let the sun come streaming in
Cause you'll reach up and you'll rise again
Lift your head and look around
You will be found

There's a place where we don't have to feel unknown
And every time that you call out
You're a little less alone

If you only say the word
From across the silence
Your voice is heard

So let the sun come streaming in
Cause you'll reach up and you'll rise again
If you only look around
You will be found

Out of the shadows
The morning is breaking
And all is new
All is new

It's filling up the empty
And suddenly I see
That all is new
All is new

Again you're gone
Off on a different path than mine
I'm left behind
Wondering if I should follow

You had to go
And of course it's always fine
I probably could catch up with you tomorrow

But is this what it feels like,To be growing apart
When did I become the one,Who's always chasing your heart

Now I turn around and find
I am lost in the woods
North is south right is left
When you're gone

I'm the one who sees you home
But now I'm lost in the woods
And I don't know what path you are on
I'm lost in the woods

The next step was a question of how
I never thought it was a question of whether
Who am I if I'm not your guy
Where am I if we're not together
Forever

Now I know you're my true north
'Cause I am lost in the woods
Up is down day is night
When you're not there

Oh you're my only landmark
So I'm lost in the woods
Wondering if you still care
But I'll wait
For a sign
That I'm your path
'Cause you are mine

My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher
But there are things that the Homilies and hymns won't teach ya
My mother was a genius
My father commanded respect
When they died they left no instructions
Just a legacy to protect

Death doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall And we break
And we make our mistakes

And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When everyone who loves me has died
I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it

I am the one thing in life I can control
Wait for it Wait for it
Wait for it Wait for it
I am inimitable
I am an original
Wait for it Wait for it

Hamilton faces an endless uphill climb
He has something to prove
He has nothing to lose
Hamilton's pace is relentless
He wastes no time
What is it like in his shoes?

Kiss Me Too Fiercely
Hold Me Too Tight
I Need Help Believing
You'Re With Me Tonight

My Wildest Dreamings
Could Not Foresee
Lying Beside You
With You Wanting Me

Just For This Moment
As Long As You'Re Mine
I'Ve Lost All Resistance
And Crossed Some Borderline

And If It Turns Out
It'S Over Too Fast
I'Ll Make Ev'Ry Last Moment Last
As Long As You'Re Mine…

Maybe I'M Brainless
Maybe I'M Wise
But You'Ve Got Me Seeing
Through Different Eyes

Somehow I'Ve Fallen
Under Your Spell
And Somehow I'M Feeling
It'S "Up" That I Fell ...

Every Moment
As Long As You'Re Mine
I'Ll Wake Up My Body
And Make Up For Lost Time...

Say There'S No Future
For Us As A Pair ...
And Though I May Know
I Don'T Care …

Just For This Moment
As Long As You'Re Mine
Come Be How You Want To
And See How Bright We Shine

Borrow The Moonlight
Until It Is Through
And Know I'Ll Be Here Holding You
As Long As You'Re Mine...

Hands touch
Eyes meet
Sudden silence
Sudden heat
Hearts leap in a giddy whirl
He could be that boy
But I'm not that girl

Don't dream
Too far
Don't lose sight of
Who you are
Don't remember that rush of joy
He could be that boy
I'm not that girl

Every so often we long to steal
To the land of what might have been
But that doesn't soften the ache we feel
When reality sets back in

Blithe smile
Lithe limb
She who's winsome
She wins him

Gold hair with a gentle curl
That's the girl he chose
And heaven knows
I'm not that girl

Don't wish
Don't start
Wishing only wounds the heart
I wasn't born for the rose and pearl
There's a girl I know
He loves her so
I'm not that girl

Superboy and the invisible girl
Son of steel and daughter of air
He's a hero a lover a prince
She's not there

Superboy and the invisible girl
Everything a kid oughtta be
He's immortal forever alive
Then there's me

I wish I could fly
And magically appear and disappear
I wish I could fly
I'd fly far away from here

Superboy and the invisible girl
He's the one you wish would appear
He's your hero forever your son
He's not here
I am here

You know that's not true
You're our little pride and joy our perfect plan
You know I love you
I love you as much as I can

Take a look at the invisible girl
Here she is clear as the day
Please look closely and find her before
She fades away

In the eye of a hurricane
There is quiet
For just a moment
A yellow sky

When I was seventeen a hurricane
Destroyed my town
I didn't drown
I couldn't seem to die

I wrote my way out
Wrote everything down far as I could see
I wrote my way out
I looked up and the town had its eyes on me

They passed a plate around
Total strangers
Moved to kindness by my story
Raised enough for me to book passage on a
Ship that was New York bound

I wrote my way out of hell
I wrote my way to revolution
I was louder than the crack in the bell
I wrote Eliza love letters until she fell
I wrote about The Constitution and defended it well

And in the face of ignorance and resistance
I wrote financial systems into existence
And when my prayers to God were met with indifference
I picked up a pen, I wrote my own deliverance

It was a February day
When your dad came by, before going away
A U-Haul truck in the driveway
The day it was suddenly real

I told you not to come outside
But you saw that truck
And you smiled so wide
A real live truck in your driveway
We let you sit behind the wheel
Goodbye, goodbye
Now it's just me and my little guy

And the house felt so big, and I felt so small
The house felt so big
and I felt so small

That night, I tucked you into bed
I will never forget how you sat up and said
"Is there another truck coming to our driveway?
A truck that will take mommy away"

And I knew there would be moments that I'd miss
And I knew there would be space I couldn't fill
And I knew I'd come up short a billion different ways
And I did
And I do
And I will

But like that February day
I will take your hand, squeeze it tightly and say
There's not another truck in the driveway
Your mom isn't going anywhere
Your mom is staying right here

No matter what
I'll be here
When it all feels so big
'Til it all feels so small

I'm what you want me to be
And I'm your worst fear You'll find it in me
Come closer
Come closer

I am more than memory
I am what might be I am mystery
You know me
So show me

When I appear
It's not so clear if
I'm a simple spirit or I'm flesh and blood
But I'm alive
I'm alive
I am so alive

And I feed on the fear
That's behind your eyes
And I need you to need me
It's no surprise
I'm alive
So alive
I'm alive

I am flame and I am fire
I am destruction
Decay and desire
I'll hurt you
I'll heal you
I'm your wish Your dream come true
And I am your darkest nightmare too

I've shown you
I own you
And though you made me
You can't change me

I'm the perfect stranger
Who knows you too well
And I'm alive
I'm alive
I am so alive

And I'll tell you the truth
If you let me try
You're alive
I'm alive
And I'll show you why

I'm alive
I'm right behind you
You say forget 
but I remind you
You can try to hide You know that I will find you
'Cause if you won't grieve me You won't leave me behind

I'm alive
I am so alive
If you climb on my back Then we both can fly
If you try to deny me I'll never die
I'm alive
So alive
I'm alive

Welcome to the show, to the historemix
Switching up the flow as we add the prefix
Everybody knows that we used to be six wives

Raising up the roof 'till we hit the ceiling
Get ready for the truth that we'll be revealing
Everybody knows that we used to be six wives
But now we're Ex-wives.

All you ever hear and read about
Is our ex, and the way it ended
But a pair doesn't beat a royal flush
You're gonna find out how he got unfriended

Tonight, we're gonna do ourselves justice
'cause we're taking you to court
every Tudor rose has it's thorns
and you're gonna hear 'em live, in consort

You know I love you, boy
In every single way
Though I love you, boy
I'll miss you every day
Oh I love you, boy
I wish that I could stay with you
And keep the life I made with you

And even though this feels so right
I'm holding back the tears tonight
It's true I'll never be over you
'Cause I have built a future in my mind with you

And now the hope is gone
There's nothing left for me to do
You know it isn't true
But I must say to you

So I sent that letter to my love
Got married to the king
Became the one who survived

I've told you about my life
The final wife
But why should that story
Be the one I have to sing about
Just to win? I'm out
That's not my story
There's so much more

Remember that I was a writer
I wrote books and songs and meditations
Fought for female education
So all my women could independently
Study scripture
I even got a woman to paint my picture

Why can't I tell that story?
'Cause in history
I'm fixed as one of six
And without him
I disappear
We all disappear

Maybe I've lost it at last
Maybe my last lucid moment has passed
I'm dancing with death, I suppose
But really who knows?

Maybe I'm tired of the game
Of coming up short of the rules of the shame
And maybe you feel that way too
I see me in you

A girl full of anger and hope
A girl with a mother who just couldn't cope
A girl who felt caught and thought no one could see
That maybe one day she'll be free

It's so lovely that you're sharing
No really I'm all ears
But where has all this caring been for sixteen years?
For all those years I'd prayed that you'd go away for good

Half the time afraid that you really would
When I thought you might be dying
I cried for all we've never be
But there'll be no more crying, not for me

We tried to give you a normal life
I realize now I have no clue what that is

I don't need a life that's normal, that's way too far away
But something next to normal would be okay

Yeah, something next to normal
That's the thing I'd like to try
Close enough to normal to get by
We'll get by

I've decided to make you my new project!
You really don't have to do that...
I know, that's what makes me so nice!

Whenever I see someone less fortunate than I
And let's face it
who isn't less fortunate than I?
My tender heart tends to start to bleed.

And when someone needs a makeover
I simply have to take over!
I know, I know exactly what they need!

And even in your case
Though it's the toughest case I've yet to face
Don't worry, I'm determined to succeed!
Follow my lead
And yes indeed, you will be...
Popular!

You're gonna be popular!
I'll teach you the proper poise
When you talk to boys
Little ways to flirt and flounce

I'll show you what shoes to wear!
How to fix your hair!
Everything that really counts to be...
POPULAR!

I'll help you be popular!
You'll hang with the right cohorts
You'll be good at sports
Know the slang you've got to know.
So let's start
'Cause you've got an awfully long way to go!

Don't be offended by my frank analysis
Think of it as personality dialysis
Now that I've chosen to become a
Pal, a sis or an advisor
There's nobody wiser!
Not when it comes to...
POPULAR!

I know about popular.
and with an assist from me
to be who you'll be
instead of dreary who you were...
Well, are.

There's nothing that can stop you
from becoming popu-ler... lar...

When i see depressing creatures
With unprepossessing features
I remind them on their own they have
To - think - of

Celebrated heads of state
Or specially great communicators!
Did they have brains or knowledge?
Don't make me laugh!

It's all about popular.
It's not about aptitude
It's the way you're viewed
So it's very shrewd to be
Very very popular
like ME!

Make me a channel of your peace
Where there is hatred
Let me bring your love
Where there is injury
Your pardon, Lord
And where there's doubt
True faith in you

Make me a channel of your peace
Where there's despair in life
Let me bring hope
Where there is darkness, only light
And where there's sadness, ever joy

On my own
Pretending he's beside me
All alone
I walk with him till morning

Without him
I feel his arms around me
And when I lose my way I close my eyes
And he has found me

In the rain the pavement shines like silver
All the lights are misty in the river
In the darkness, the trees are full of starlight
And all I see is him and me forever and forever

And I know it's only in my mind
That I'm talking to myself and not to him
And although I know that he is blind
Still I say, there's a way for us

I love him
But when the night is over
He is gone
The river's just a river

Without him
The world around me changes
The trees are bare and everywhere
The streets are full of strangers

I love him
But every day I'm learning
All my life
I've only been pretending

Without me
His world would go on turning
A world that's full of happiness
That I have never known

You wait little girl on an empty stage
For fate to turn the light on
Your life little girl is an empty page
That men will want to write on

You are sixteen going on seventeen, 
baby it's time to think
Better beware, be canny and careful, 
baby you're on the brink

You are sixteen going on seventeen, 
fellows will fall in line
Eager young lads, and roues and cads
Will offer you food and wine

Totally unprepared are you, 
to face a world of men
Timid and shy and scared are you, 
of things beyond your ken

You need someone older and wiser, 
telling you what to do
I am seventeen going on eighteen, 
I'll take care of you

Stop the world
Take a picture
Try to capture
To ensure this moment lasts

We're still in it, 
but in a minute
That's the limit
And this present will be past

So here we are
Where the world has come together
So here she will be
In this picture, forever

Stop the world
Seize the moment
But the minute he goes you're alone, and it's through
Pinch yourself
Tell yourself:
You're just dreaming, that means he'll forget about you

But here we are
Where the continents once crashed together
Before they went their separate ways forever, so
Stop the world

They're the perfect Loving family so adoring And I love them
Every day of every week
So my son's a little jerk My husband's boring
And my daughter Though a genius is a freak

Still I help them Love each other
Father mother Sister brother
Cheek to cheek
Natalie it's four in the morning is everything ok

If they love each other Or if they just fake it
And if other daughter Feel like I feel too
'Cause some days I think I'm dying
But I'm really only Trying to get through

For just another day
For another stolen hour
When the world will Feel my power and obey

It's just another day
Feeling like I'll live forever
Feeling like this feeling never goes away

For just another day
When it's up to you To hold your house together
A house you built with Patience and with care
But you're grappling with That grey and rainy weather
And you're living on a latte And a prayer

For just another day
In the hustle and the hurry
You want to wipe Your worry clean away

For just another day
I will keep the Plates all spinning
With a smile so white And winning all the way
'Cause what doesn't kill me Doesn't kill me
So fill me up For just another day

It only hurts when I breathe
It only hurts when I try
It only hurts when I think
It only hurts when I cry
It only hurts when I work
It only hurts when I play
It only hurts when I move

It's just another day a busy busy day
And the morning sun Is stunning 
I will hold it all together
And you wish that you Were running far away 
I will hide the mess away

It's just another day 
and I'll survive another day
Birds are singing Things are growing
And I will pray To hold on
And you wish You could be going But you stay and you stay
And stay forever and for my family's sake

Every day is just another
And another and another
I will hold it all together
We're the perfect loving family

The perfect loving family
I will keep the plates all spinning
And the world just keeps on spinning
And I think the house is spinning

I've learned to slam on the brake
Before I even turn the key
Before I make the mistake
Before I lead with the worst of me

Give them no reason to stare
No slipping up if you slip away
So I've got nothing to share
No, I got nothing to say

Step out, step out of the sun
If you keep getting burned
Step out, step out of the sun
Because you've learned
because you've learned

On the outside always looking in
Will I ever be more than I've always been?
'cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass
I'm waving through a window

I try to speak, but nobody can hear
So I wait around for an answer to appear
While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass
I'm waving through a window
Oh, can anybody see
is anybody waving back at me?

We start with stars in our eyes
We start believing that we belong
But every sun doesn't rise
And no one tells you where you went wrong

Step out, step out of the sun
If you keep getting burned
Step out, step out of the sun
Because you've learned
because you've learned

On the outside always looking in
Will I ever be more than I've always been?
'cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass
Waving through a window

I try to speak, but nobody can hear
So I wait around for an answer to appear
While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass
Waving through a window
Oh, can anybody see
is anybody waving?

When you're falling in a forest
and there's nobody around
Do you ever really crash
or even make a sound

Hans Holbein goes around the world
Painting all of the beautiful girls
From Spain, to France
And Germany
The king chooses one
But which one will it be?

You bring the corsets
We'll bring the cinches
No one wants a waist over nine inches

So what the make-up contains lead poison?
At least your complexion will bring all the boys in

Ignore the fear and you'll be fine
We'll turn this vier into a nine
So just say 'ja' and don't say 'nein'
'Cause now you're in the house
In the Haus of Holbein!

We must make sure the princesses look great
When their time comes for the Holbein portrait
We know what all the best inventions are
To hold everything up

For blonder hair, then you just add a
Magical ingredient from your bladder
Try these heels, so high it's naughty
But we cannot guarantee that you'll still walk at forty

I was cheated by you And I think you know when.
So I made up my mind, it must come to an end
Look at me now, will I ever learn?

I don't know how but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything

Don't breathe too deep
Don't think all day
Dive into work
Drive the other way

That drip of hurt
That pint of shame
Goes away
Just play the game

You're living in America
At the end of the millennium
You're living in America
Leave your conscience at the tone
And when you're living in America
At the end of the millennium

So I own not a notion
I escape and ape content
I don't own emotion -- I rent

Hear me now, O thou bleak and unbearable world
Thou art base and debauched as can be
And a knight with his banners all bravely unfurled
Now hurls down his gauntlet to thee!

I am I, Don Quixote, the Lord of La Mancha
My destiny calls and I go
And the wild winds of fortune will carry me onward
Oh, whithersoever they blow
Whithersoever they blow, onward to glory I go

I'm Sancho, yes, I'm Sancho
I'll follow my master till the end
I'll tell all the world proudly
I'm his squire, I'm his friend

Hear me heathens and wizards and serpents of sin
All your dastardly doings are past
For a holy endeavor is now to begin
And virtue shall triumph at last

The sun is shining
It's a lovely day
A perfect morning
For a kid to play
But you're got lots
Of bills to pay
What can you do?

Your work real hard
And the pay's real low
And every hour
Goes oh, so slow
And at the end of the day
There's no where to go
But home to Avenue Q!

You live on Avenue Q!
You're friends do too.
You are twenty-two
And you live on Avenue Q!

To dream the impossible dream
To fight the unbeatable foe
To bear with unbearable sorrow
To run where the brave dare not go;

To right the unrightable wrong.
To love, pure and chaste, from afar
To try, when your arms are too weary
To reach the unreachable star!

This is my Quest to follow that star
No matter how hopeless, no matter how far

To fight for the right
Without question or pause
To be willing to march into hell
For a heavenly cause!

And I know, if I'll only be true
To this glorious Quest
That my heart will lie peaceful and calm
When I'm laid to my rest.

And the world will be better for this
That one man, scorned and covered with scars
Still strove, with his last ounce of courage
To reach the unreachable stars!

Sure, I came out here
To make my name
Wanted my pool, my dose of fame
Wanted my parking space at warners.

But, after a year
A one-room hell
A murphy bed
A rancid smell
Wallpaper peeling at the corners

Sunset boulevard
Twisting boulevard
Secretive and rich, a little scary.

Sunset boulevard
Tempting boulevard
Waiting there to swallow the unwary.

Dreams are not enough
To win a war
Out here they're always keeping score
Beneath the tan, the battle rages.

Smile a rented smile
Fill someone's glass
Kiss someone's wife
Kiss someone's ass
We do whatever pays the wages.

Sunset boulevard
Headline boulevard
Getting here is only the beginning.

Sunset boulevard
Jackpot boulevard
Once you've won you have to go on winning.

You think I've sold out?
Damn right I've sold out.
I just been waiting
For the right offer:

Comfortable quarters
Regular rations
24-hour five-star room service.
And if I'm honest
I like the lady

I can't help being
Touched by her folly.
I'm treading water
Taking her money
Watching her sunset...

L.A's changed a lot
Over the years
Since those brave gold rush pioneers
Came in their creaky covered wagons.

Far as they could go
End of the line
Their dreams were yours
Their dreams were mine
But in those dreams
Were hidden dragons.

Sunset boulevard
Frenzied boulevard
Swamped with every kind of false emotion.

Sunset boulevard
Brutal boulevard
Just like you, we'll wind up in the ocean.

She was sinking fast
I threw a rope
Now I have suites
And she has hope
It seemed an elegant solution.

One day this must end
It isn't real
Still I'll enjoy
A hearty meal
Before tomorrow's execution.

Sunset boulevard
Ruthless boulevard
Destination for the stony-hearted.

Sunset boulevard
Lethal boulevard
Everyone's forgotten how they started

I've seen dark before
But not like this
This is cold
This is empty
This is numb

The life I knew is over
The light's are out
Hello darkness
I'm ready to succumb

I follow you around,I always have
But you've gone to a place I cannot find
This grief has a gravity,It pulls me down
But a tiny voice whispers in my mind

You are lost hope is gone
But you must go on
And do the next right thing

Can there be a day beyond this night
I don't know anymore what is true
I can't find my direction I'm all alone
The only star that guided me was you

How to rise from the floor
When it's not you I'm rising for
Just do the next right thing
Take a step step again
It is all that I can to do
The next right thing

I won't look too far ahead
It's too much for me to take
But break it down to this next breath
This next step, This next choice is one that I can make

So I'll walk through this night
Stumbling blindly toward the light
And do the next right thing
And with the dawn what comes then

When it's clear that everything will never be the same again
Then I'll make the choice
To hear that voice
And do the next right thing

We need some light
First of all We need some light
You can't sit here In the dark And all alone
It's a sorry sight
It's just you and me
We'll live
You'll see

Night after night
We'd sit and wait For the morning light
But we've waited far too long
For all that's wrong To be made right

Day after day
Wishing all our cares away
Trying to fight the things we feel
But some hurts never heal

Some ghosts are never gone
But we go on
We still go on
And you find some way to survive
And you find out you don't have To be happy at all

Day after day
Give me clouds and rain and grey
Give me pain if that's what's real
It's the price we pay to feel
The price of love is loss
But still we pay
We love anyway

And when they night has fin'ly gone
And when we see the new day dawn
We'll wonder how we wandered for So long so blind
The wasted world we thought we knew
The light will make it look brand new
So let it Shine

Day after day
We'll find the will to find our way
Knowing that the darkest sky
Will someday see the sun

When our long night is done
There will be light
When we open up our lives
Sons and daughters Husbands wives
And fight that fight
There will be light

Live in my house, I'll be your shelter
Just pay me back
With one thousand kisses
Be my lover - I'll cover you

Open your door, I'll be your tenant
Don't got much baggage, to lay at your feet
But sweet kisses I've got to spare
I'll be there and I'll cover you

I think they meant it
When they said you can't buy love
Now I know you can rent it
A new lease you are my love
On life - be my life

Just slip me on I'll be your blanket
Wherever - whatever - I'll be your coat

You'll be my king
And I'll be your castle
No you'll be my queen
And I'll be your moat

I've longed to discover
Something as true as this is

Never again will she get the best of me
Never again will she take away my freedom
And we won't forget the day we fought for the right
To be a little bit naughty.

Never again, will the chokey door slam.
Never again, will I be bullied and
Never again will I doubt it when my mummy says I'm a miracle.

We are revolting children, living in revolting times
We sing revolting songs, using revolting rhymes.
We'll be revolting children til our revoltings done
And we'll have the Trunchbull bolting, we're REVOLTING!

We will become a screaming hoard.
Take out your hockey sticks and use it as a sword.
Never again will we be ignored.
We'll find out where the chalk is stored
And draw rude pictures on the board.

To life, to life, l'chai-im
L'chai-im, l'chai-im, to life.
Here's to the father I tried to be!
Here's to my bride-to-be!

Life has a way of confusing us
Blessing and bruising us.

God would like us to be joyful
Even when our hearts lie panting on the floor.

How much more can we be joyful
When there's really something to be joyful for?

We'll raise a glass and sip a drop of schnappes
In honor of the great good luck that favors you.
We know that when good fortune favors two such men
It stands to reason, we deserve it too!

To us and our good fortune
Be happy, be healthy, long life!
And if our good fortune never comes
Here's to whatever comes.
Drink l'chai-im, to life!

Will I lose my dignity
Will someone care
Will I wake tomorrow
From this nightmare?

I saw you light the ballroom
With your sparkling eyes so blue
Graceful as an angel's wing
I dreamed a dance with you

You whispered slyly softly
You told me you would be true
We spun around a thousand stars
I dreamed a dance with you

I know the night is dying dear
I know the day will dawn
The dancers may disappear
Still the dance goes on and on
I'll wake alone tomorrow
The dream of our dance is through

But now until forever love
I'll live to dance with you
I'll dream my love I'll live my love
And I'll die to dance with

There's a world there's a world I know
A place we can go where the pain will go away
There's a world where the sun shines each day

There's a world there's a world out there
I'll show you just where
And in time I know you'll see

There's a world where we can be free
Come with me
Come with me

so tell me do you wanna go?
Where it's covered in all the colored lights
Where the runaways are running the night
Impossible comes true, it's taking over you
Oh, this is the greatest show

We light it up, we won't come down
And the sun can't stop us now
Watching it come true, it's taking over you
Oh, this is the greatest show

Don't fight it, it's coming for you, running at ya
It's only this moment, don't care what comes after
It's blinding outside and I think that you know
Just surrender 'cause you're calling and you wanna go

It's everything you ever want
It's everything you ever need
And it's here right in front of you
This is where you wanna be

The window is open, so's that door
I didn't know they did that anymore
Who knew we owned eight thousands salad plates?

For years I've roamed these empty halls
Why have a ballroom with no balls?
Finally they're opening up the gates

There'll be actual real live people
It'll be totally strange
Wow, am I so ready for this change

Cuz for the first time in forever
There'll be music, there'll be light
For the first time in forever
I'll be dancing through the night

Don't know if I'm elated or gassy
But I'm somewhere in that zone
Cuz for the first time in forever
I won't be alone

Tonight imagine me gown and all
fetchingly draped against the wall
The picture of sophisticated grace

I suddenly see him standing there
a beautiful stranger, tall and fair
I wanna stuff some chocolate in my face

But then we laugh and talk all evening
Which is totally bizarre
Nothing like the life I've led so far

For the first time in forever
There'll be magic, there'll be fun
For the first time in forever
I could be noticed by someone

And I know it's totally crazy
To dream I'd find romance
But for the first time in forever
At least I've got a chance

Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel, put on a show
Make one wrong move and everyone will know

For the first time in forever
I'm getting what I'm dreaming of
A chance to change my lonely world
A chance to find true love

I know it all ends tomorrow
So it has to be today
Cuz for the first time in forever
For the first time in forever
Nothing's in my way!

He got down on one knee but I said no way
Packed my bags and moved into a nu nu nunneray
Joined the gospel choir our riffs were on fire
At the top of the charts is where I'm gonna stay

Henry sent me a poem all about my green sleeves
I changed a couple words put it on a sick beat
The song blew their minds next minute I was signed
And now I'm writing lyrics for Shakesy P

Since my first son, our family's grown
We made a band and got quite well known
You could perhaps call us the Tudor Von Trapps
I'm just kidding, we're called the Royalling Stones

We're one of a kind no category
Too many years lost in his story
We're free to take, our crowning glory
For five more minutes
We're Six

What a shame yeah my face it cost me the crown
So I moved to the Haus of Holbein in my hometown
His mates were super arty
but I showed them how to party
Now on my tour of Prussia everybody gets down

Music man tried it on and I was like bye
So I thought "Who needs him?"
I can give it a try
I learned everything
Now all I do is sing
And I'll do that until I die

Heard all about these rockin' chicks
Loved every song and each remix
So I went out and found them
And we lay down an album
Now I don't need your love, all I need is Six

It's the end of the show of the historemix
We switched up the flow and we changed the prefix
Everybody knows that we used to be six wives

I'm limited...Just look at me...I'm limited
And just look at you, You can do all I couldn't do,Glinda
So now it's up to you. For both of us. Now it's up to you.

I've heard it said
That people come into our lives
For a reason
Bringing something we must learn

And we are led to those
Who help us most to grow
If we let them
And we help them in return

Well, I don't know if I believe that's true
But I know I'm who I am today
Because I knew you.

Like a comet pulled from orbit
As it passes a sun.
Like a stream that meets a boulder
Halfway through the wood
Who can say if I've been changed for the better
Because I knew you
I have been changed for good.

It well may be
That we will never meet again
In this lifetime.
So let me say before we part

So much of me
Is made of what I learned from you
You'll be with me
Like a handprint on my heart

And now whatever way our stories end
I know you have rewritten mine
By being my friend.

Like a ship blown from its mooring
By a wind off the sea.
Like a seed dropped by a skybird
In a distant wood

Who can say if I've been changed for the better
Because I knew you
Because I knew you
I have been changed for good.

And just to clear the air
I ask forgiveness for the things I've done you blame me for.
But then, I guess
We know there's blame to share
And none of it seems to matter anymore

On the edge of the world or wherever we are
We are – we are – we are on the edge
Is there something - I need to do something
To keep me from thinking of all those scenes on the tube
I need something to do – 'cause I can't watch the news
No, I can't watch the news anymore

When I grow up
I will be brave enough to fight the creatures
That you have to fight beneath the bed
Each night to be a grown up.

Just because you find that life's not fair
it doesn't mean that you just have to grin and bear it!
If you always take it on the chin and wear it
Nothing will change.

Just because I find myself in this story
It doesn't mean that everything is written for me.
If I think the ending is fixed already
I might as well be saying I think that it's OK
And that's not right!

how do you measure-measure a year
in daylights- in sunsets
in midnights- in cups of coffee
in inches- in miles
in laughter- in strife

how do you measure the life of a woman or a man
in truth that she learns
or in times that he cried
in bridges he burned
or the way that she dies

it's time now to sing out
though the story never ends
let's celebrate
remember a year in the life of friends

On the North-East tip of North America
On an island called Newfoundland
There's an airport.
It used to be one of the biggest airports in the world
And next to it is a town called Gander.

Welcome to the Rock if you come from away
You probably understand about a half of what we say
They say no man's an island, but an island makes a man

That mornin' I'm in the classroom
It's our first day back and the school buses are on strike!
So, I'm covering for Annette who's running late.

Welcome to the Rock!
An Islander. I am an Islander.
I'm an Islander. I am an Islander.

You are here
At the start of a moment
On the edge of the world
Where the river meets the sea

Here
On the edge of the Atlantic
On an island in between
There and here

Welcome to the fog
Welcome to the trees
To the ocean and the sky
And whatever's in between

To the one's who've left
You're never truly gone
A candle's in the window
And a kettle's always on

When the sun is coming up
And the world has come ashore
If you're hoping for a harbour
Then you'll find an open door

In the winter, from the water
Through whatever's in the way
To the one's who have come from away
Welcome to the Rock!

There was a time when I flew higher
Was a time the wild girl running free
Would be me

Now I see her feel the fire
Now I know she needs me There to share
I'm nowhere

All these blank and tranquil years
Seems they've dried up all my tears
And while she runs free and fast
Seems my wild days are past

But I miss the mountains
I miss the dizzy heights
All the manic magic days
And the dark depressing nights

I miss the mountains
I miss the highs and lows
All the climbing all the falling
All the while the wild wind blows

Stinging you with snow
And soaking you with rain
I miss the mountains
I miss the pain

Mountains make you crazy
Here it's safe and sound
My mind is somewhere hazy
My feet are on the ground

Everything is balanced here
And on an even keel
Everything is perfect
Nothing's real Nothing's real

And I miss the mountains
I miss the lonely climb
Wandering through the wilderness
And spending all my time
Where the air is clear
And cuts you like a knife

I miss the mountains
I I miss the mountains
I miss my life
I miss my life

You've got a good heart
But I know it changes.
A restless tide, untamable.
You came my way
and I knew a storm could come too
You'd lift me high, or let me fall.

But I took your hand, promised I'd withstand
Any blaze you blew my way.
'Cause something inside, it solidified
And I knew I'd always stay.

You can build me up, you can tear me down
You can try but I'm unbreakable.
You can do your best, but I'll stand the test.
You'll find that I'm unshakeable.

When the fire's burnt
When the wind has blown
When the water's dried, you'll still find stone.
My heart of stone.

You say we're perfect.
A perfect family.
You hold us close, for the world to see.
And when I say you're the only one I've ever loved
I mean those words truthfully.

But I know
Without my son your love could disappear.
I know it isn't fair, but I don't care
'Cause my love, will still be here.

You can build me up, you can tear me down
You can try but I'm unbreakable.
You can do your best, but I'll stand the test.
You'll find that I'm unshakeable.

When the fire's burnt
The wind has blown
The water's dried, you'll still find stone.
My heart of stone.

Soon I'll have to go.
I'll never see him grow.
But I hope my son will know
He'll never be alone.

'Cause like a river runs dry
And leaves its scars behind
I'll be by your side
'Cause my love
Is set in stone.

End of May or early June
This picture-perfect afternoon we shared
Drive the winding country road
Grab a scoop at à La Mode

And then we're there
An open field that's framed with trees
We pick a spot and shoot the breeze
Like buddies do

Quoting songs by our favorite bands
Telling jokes no one understands
Except us two
And we talk and take in the view

All we see is sky for forever
We let the world pass by for forever
Feels like we could go on for forever this way
Two friends on a perfect day

We walk a while and talk about
The things we'll do when we get out of school
Bike the Appalachian trail or
Write a book or learn to sail
Wouldn't that be cool?

There's nothing that we can't discuss
Like girls we wish would notice us but never do
He looks around and says to me
"There's nowhere else I'd rather be"
And I say, "Me too"

And there he goes
Racing toward the tallest tree
From far across the yellow field I hear him calling, "Follow me"

There we go
Wondering how the world might look from up so high
One foot after the other
One branch then to another
I climb higher and higher
I climb till the entire

Sun shines on my face
And I suddenly feel the branch give way
I'm on the ground
My arm goes numb

I look around
And I see him come to get me
He's come to get me
And everything's okay

why couldn't you have stayed calm for once. Instead of flying off the handle
I hope you're happy
I hope you're happy now
I hope you're happy how you
Hurt your 'cause forever
I hope you think you're clever

I hope you're happy
I hope you're happy, too
I hope you're proud how you
Would grovel in submission
To feed your own ambition

So though I can't imagine how
I hope you're happy right now

listen to me, just say you're sorry
You can still be with the Wizard
What you've worked and waited for
You can have all you ever wanted

Something has changed within me
Something is not the same
I'm through with playing by the rules
Of someone else's game

Too late for second guessing
Too late to go back to sleep
It's time to trust my instincts
Close my eyes and leap

It's time to try
Defying gravity
I think I'll try
Defying gravity
And you can't pull me down

Can't I make you understand?
You're having delusions of grandeur

I'm through accepting limits
'Cause someone says they're so
Some things I cannot change
But till I try, I'll never know

Too long I've been afraid of
Losing love I guess I've lost
Well, if that's love
It comes at much too high a cost

I'd sooner buy defying gravity
Kiss me goodbye
I'm defying gravity
And you can't pull me down

come with me
Think of what we could do together
Unlimited, together we're unlimited
Together we'll be the greatest team
There's ever been

Dreams the way we planned
If we work in tandem
There's no fight we cannot win

Just you and I
Defying gravity
With you and I
Defying gravity
They'll never bring us down

So if you care to find me
Look to the western sky
As someone told me lately
"Ev'ryone deserves the chance to fly"

And if I'm flying solo
At least I'm flying free
To those who'd ground me
Take a message back from me

Tell them how I am
Defying gravity
I'm flying high
Defying gravity

And soon I'll match them in renown
And nobody in all of Oz
No Wizard that there is or was
Is ever gonna bring me down

Why should I play this game of pretend?
Remembering through a secondhand sorrow?
Such a great son and wonderful friend
Oh, don't the tears just pour

I could curl up and hide in my room
There in my bed, still sobbing tomorrow
I could give in to all of the gloom
But tell me, tell me what for

Why should I have a heavy heart?
Why should I start to break in pieces?
Why should I go and fall apart for you?
Why should I play the grieving girl and lie
Saying that I miss you
And that my world has gone dark without your light?
I will sing no requiem tonight

I gave you the world, you threw it away
Leaving these broken pieces behind you
Everything wasted, nothing to say
So I can sing no requiem

I hear your voice, I feel you near
Within these words, I finally find you
And now that I know that you are still here
I will sing no requiem tonight

The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation 
and it looks like I'm the Queen
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried

Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl You always have to be
Conceal, don't feel, Don't let them know
Well, now they know

Let it go, Let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go, Let it go
Turn away and slam the door

I don't care
What they're going to say
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway

It's funny how some distance
Makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me
Can't get to me at all

It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me, I'm free

Let it go, Let it go
I am one with the wind and sky
Let it go, Let it go
You'll never see me cry

Here I stand, And here I'll stay
Let the storm rage on

My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast

I'm never going back, The past is in the past
Let it go, Let it go
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, Let it go
That perfect girl is gone

Here I stand in the light of day
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway

Where the north wind meets the sea
There's a river full of memory
Sleep, my darling, safe and sound
For in this river all is found

In her waters, deep and true
Lie the answers and a path for you
Dive down deep into her sound
But not too far or you'll be drowned

Yes, she will sing to those who'll hear
And in her song, all magic flows
But can you brave what you most fear?
Can you face what the river knows?

Where the north wind meets the sea
There's a mother full of memory
Come, my darling, homeward bound
When all is lost, then all is found

Yes the wind blows a little bit colder
And we're all getting older
And the clouds are moving on with every autumn breeze

Peter Pumpkin just became fertilizer
And my leaf's a little sadder and wiser
That's why I rely on certain certainties

some things never change
Like the feel of your hand in mine
Some things stay the same
Like how we get along just fine

Like an old stone wall that'll never fall
Some things are always true
Some things never change
Like how I'm holding on tight to you

The leaves are already falling
Sven it feels like the future is calling
Are you telling me tonight you're gonna get down on one knee
Yeah bud I'm really bad at planning these things out
Like candlelight and pulling of rings out
Maybe you should leave all the romantic stuff to me

Yeah some things never change
Like the love that I feel for her
Some things stay the same
Like how reindeers are easier

But if I commit and I go for it
I'll know what to say and do
Right
Some things never change
Sven the pressure is all on you

The winds are restless
Could that be why I'm hearing this call
Is something coming
I'm not sure I want things to change at all

These days are precious
Can't let them slip away
I can't freeze this moment
But I can still go out and seize this day

The wind blows a little bit colder
And you all look a little bit older
It's time to count our blessings
Beneath an autumn sky

We'll always live in a kingdom of plenty
That stands for the good and the many
And I promise you the flag of Arendelle will always fly

Some things never change
Turn around and the time has flown
Some things stay the same
Though the future remains unknown

May our good luck last
May our past be past
Time's moving fast it's true
Some things never change
And I'm holding on tight to you

If the world is gonna end tomorrow
Wallowing in sorrow won't get us anywhere
You'll find all the strength you need is inside
Like Poseidon ridin' 'cross the tide
Don't let this moment pass by

Hero is my middle name
Fixing trouble is my game
Just give it the old know how
There's no better time than now

Don't give up and don't give in
If you're thinking sink or swim
Courage is your plane to fame
When hero is your middle name

My machines they made a real prediction
It's not science fiction there's nothing we can do at all
Why are you waiting for the bottom to fall
It's not the time to drop the big beach ball
All for one and one for all

My parents must have thought they had a crazy kid
'Cause I was one of those kids who always knew what I wanted
They took me down to the airport to see all the planes departing
Watching them fly something inside of me was starting
I was eight when I told them that I'd be a pilot

But I was too young and too short
and there were no female captains
and my dad said, "be patient" he said, "just see what happens"
But I took my first lesson came down from the sky
and told my father I'd fly for the rest of my life

And I got my first job flying for a mortician
in a tiny bonanza, just a corpse and me
Five dollars an hour for flying dead bodies
I had to climb over their faces just to get to my seat

And suddenly the wheels lift off
the ground is falling backwards
I am suddenly alive

Suddenly I'm in the cockpit
Suddenly everything's changed
Suddenly I'm not too young or too short
and the passengers in the back don't complain

Suddenly I'm flying company charters
Suddenly everything's high
Suddenly there's nothing in between me and the sky
American Airlines had the prettiest planes
So I applied as a flight engineer

But the World War II pilots, they all complained
They said, "girls shouldn't be in the cockpit"
"Hey lady, hey baby, hey! Why don't you grab us a drink?"
And the flight attendants weren't my friends back then
and they said, "Are you better than us, do you think?"

But I kept getting hired
And the World War II crew, they retired
And the girls all thought much higher of me
1986 the first female American captain in history

Suddenly I'm in the cockpit
Suddenly I've got my wings
Suddenly all of those pilots protested me
Well, they can get their own drinks

Suddenly there's no one saying, "Stay grounded"
Looking down passing them by
Suddenly there's nothing in between me and the sky

Suddenly I've got an all female crew
The news talked, it made headlines across the world
Suddenly it stopped
No one saying, "You can't" or "You won't"
or "You know you're not anything 'cause you're a girl"

Suddenly I'm getting married
and we're putting pins on the map where we've flown
Suddenly I am a mother
and suddenly shocked at how much they've grown

Suddenly I'm wondering how my parents would feel
seeing me teaching men to be pilots
'Cause suddenly I am a senior instructor
and somehow I'm 51

Suddenly I'm flying Paris to Dallas
Across The Atlantic and feeling calm
When suddenly someone on air to air traffic says
"At 8:46 there's been a terrorist action"
And the one thing I loved more than anything
was used as the bomb

Suddenly I'm in a hotel
Suddenly something has died
Suddenly there's something in between me and the sky

I don't need you to sell me on reasons to want you
I don't need you to search for the proof that I should
You don't have to convince me
You don't have to be scared you're not enough
'Cause what we've got going is good

I don't need more reminders of all that's been broken
I don't need you to fix what I'd rather forget
Clear the slate and start over
Try to quiet the noises in your head
We can't compete with all that

So what if it's us?
What if it's us
And only us
And what came before won't count anymore or matter?
Can we try that?

What if it's you
And what if it's me
And what if that's all that we need it to be
And the rest of the world falls away?
What do you say?

I never thought there'd be someone like you who would want me
So I give you ten thousand reasons to not let me go
But if you really see me
If you like me for me and nothing else
Well, that's all that I've wanted for longer that you could possibly know

Grew up in the French court
Oui, oui bonjour.
Life was a chore so, she set sail.

1522, came straight to the UK
All the British dudes lame. Epic fail.
Ooohoo, I wanna dance and sing.
Politics, not my thing.

Ooohoo, but then I met the king
And soon my daddy said
"You should try and get ahead"“

He wanted me, hah, obviously
Messaging me like everyday.
Couldn't be better then he sent me a letter
And who am I kidding I was Prêt-à-manger.

Ooohoo, sent a reply.
Ooohoo, Just sayin' Hi.
Ooohoo, you're a nice guy
I'll think about it maybe xo baby.

Sorry, not sorry 'bout, what I said
I'm just tryna' have some fun.
Don't worry, don't worry
don't lose your head,I didn't mean to hurt anyone
L-O-L, say "Oh well", or go to hell.
I'm sorry not sorry bout' what I said.
Don't lose your head.

Three in the bed
And the little one said
"If you wanna be wed, make up your mind!"
It's her or me, chum
don't wanna be some girl in a threesome
Are you blind?

Ooohoo, don't be bitter.
Ooohoo, 'Cause I'm fitter.
Ooohoo, Why hasn't it hit her?
He doesn't wanna bang you, somebody hang you.

Henry's out every night on the town
Just sleepin' around
Like what the hell?
If that's how it's gonna be
Maybe I'll flirt with a guy or three
just to make him jel
