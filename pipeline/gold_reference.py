去摘，遥不可及的星

This is my Quest to follow that star,
敢以此生 求索那颗星
No matter how hopeless, no matter how far,
管它征途遥远，道路多险峻

To fight for the right
为正义而战
Without question or pause,
不要踌躇不定
To be willing to march into hell
哪怕烧灼在地狱火中
For a heavenly cause!
也自为天道阔步前行！

And I know, if I'll only be true
我若能为这光辉使命
To this glorious Quest,
穷尽一生追寻
That my heart will lie peaceful and calm
多年后，待到长眠时分
When I'm laid to my rest.
我心亦然安宁

And the world will be better for this,
而人间定会不同往昔
That one man, scorned and covered with scars,
纵然我终将疲倦无力

Still strove, with his last ounce of courage,
仍要用伤痕累累的双手
To reach the unreachable stars!
去摘遥不可及的星
