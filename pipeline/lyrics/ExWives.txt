Welcome to the show to the historemix
Switching up the flow as we add the prefix
Everybody knows that we used to be six wives

Raising up the roof till we hit the ceiling
Get ready for the truth that we'll be revealing
Everybody knows that we used to be six wives
But now we're Ex-wives.

All you ever hear and read about
Is our ex, and the way it ended
But a pair doesn't beat a royal flush
You're gonna find out how we got unfriended

Tonight, we're gonna do ourselves justice,
cause we're taking you to court
And every Tudor rose has it's thorns
and you're gonna hear them live in consort.
