The snow glows white on the mountain tonight, Not a footprint, to be seen
A kingdom of isolation, and it looks like I'm the Queen

The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried

Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl, You always have to be

Conceal don't feel
Don't let them know
Well now they know

Let it go
Let it go
Can't hold it back anymore

I don't care
What they're going to say
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bother me anyway

My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
