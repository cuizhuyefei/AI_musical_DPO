Whenever I see someone less fortunate than I
And let's face it
Who isn't less fortunate than I?
My tender heart tends to start to bleed

And when someone needs a makeover
I simply have to take over!
I know, I know exactly what they need!

And even in your case 
Though it's the toughest case I've yet to face
Don't worry, I'm determined to succeed!
Follow my lead

you will be Popular!
You're gonna be popular!
I'll teach you the proper poise
When you talk to boys
Little ways to flirt and flounce

I'll show you what shoes to wear!
How to fix your hair!
Everything that really counts to be... 
POPULAR!
I'll help you be popular!

You'll hang with the right cohorts
You'll be good at sports
Know the slang you've got to know
So let's start
'Cause you've got an awfully long way to go!

Don't be offended by my frank analysis
Think of it as personality dialysis
Now that I've chosen to become a Pal, a sis or an advisor
There's nobody wiser!
Not when it comes to POPULAR!
I know about popular
And with an assist from me
To be who you'll be
Instead of dreary who you were...
There's nothing that can stop you From becoming popu-ler...
