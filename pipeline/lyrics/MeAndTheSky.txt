And I got my first job flying for a mortician
in a tiny bonanza, just a corpse and me
Five dollars an hour for flying dead bodies
I had to climb over their faces just to get to my seat

And suddenly the wheels lift off
the ground is falling backwards
I am suddenly alive

Suddenly I'm in the cockpit
Suddenly everything's changed
Suddenly I'm not too young or too short
and the passengers in the back don't complain

Suddenly I'm flying company charters
Suddenly everything's high
Suddenly there's nothing in between me and the sky
