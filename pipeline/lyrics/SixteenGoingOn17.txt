You wait, little girl, on an empty stage, 
For fate to turn the light on
Your life, little girl, is an empty page, 
That men will want to write on

You are sixteen going on seventeen 
Baby, it's time to think
Better beware, be canny and careful 
Baby, you're on the brink

You are sixteen going on seventeen 
Fellows will fall in line
Eager young lads and rogues and cads 
Will offer you food and wine

Totally unprepared are you 
To face a world of men
Timid and shy and scared are you 
Of things beyond your ken
