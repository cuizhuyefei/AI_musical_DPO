Never again will she get the best of me,
Never again will she take away my freedom,
And we won't forget the day we fought for the right to be a little bit naughty.
Never again, will the chokey door slam.
Never again, will I be bullied and
Never again will I doubt it when my mummy says I'm a miracle.
Never again will we live behind doors

We are revolting children, living in revolting times
We sing revolting songs, using revolting rhymes.
We'll be revolting children til our revoltings done,
And we'll have the Trunchbull bolting, we're REVOLTING!
