Step out, step out of the sun
If you keep getting burned
Step out, step out of the sun
Because you've learned, because you've learned

On the outside always looking in
Will I ever be more than I've always been?
'cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass
I'm waving through a window

I try to speak, but nobody can hear
So I wait around for an answer to appear
While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass
I'm waving through a window
Oh, can anybody see,
is anybody waving back at me?

We start with stars in our eyes
We start believing that we belong
But every sun doesn't rise
And no one tells you where you went wrong

When you're falling in a forest
and there's nobody around
Do you ever really crash,
or even make a sound
