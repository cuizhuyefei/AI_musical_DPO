Hear me now, O thou bleak and unbearable world
Thou art base, and debauched as can be
And a knight, with his banners all bravely unfurled
Now hurls down his gauntlet to thee

I am I, Don Quixote, the Lord of La Mancha
My destiny calls and I go
And the wild winds of fortune, will carry me onward
Oh whithersoever they blow
Whithersoever they blow, onward to glory I go

Hear me heathens and wizards and serpents of sin
All your dastardly doings are past
For a holy endeavor is now to begin
And virtue shall triumph at last
