He got down on one knee but I said no way
Packed my bags and moved into a nu nu nunneray
Joined the gospel choir, our riffs were on fire
At the top of the charts is where I'm gonna stay

Henry sent me a poem all about my green sleeves
I changed a couple words put it on a sick beat
The song blew their minds, next minute I was signed
And now I'm writing lyrics for Shakesy P

Since my first son, our family's grown
We made a band and got quite well known
You could perhaps call us the Tudor Von Trapps
I'm just kidding, we're called the Royalling Stones

We're one of a kind no category
Too many years lost in his story
We're free to take, our crowning glory
For five more minutes
We're Six

What a shame yeah my face it cost me the crown
So I moved to the Haus of Holbein in my hometown
His mates were super arty, but I showed them how to party
Now on my tour of Prussia everybody gets down

Music man tried it on and I was like bye
So I thought "Who needs him?", I can give it a try
I learned everything, Now all I do is sing
And I'll do that until I die

Heard all about these rockin' chicks
Loved every song and each remix
So I went out and found them, And we lay down an album
Now I don't need your love, all I need is Six
