The window is open so’s that door
I didn’t know they did that anymore
Who knew we owned eight thousands salad plates?

For years I’ve roamed these empty halls
Why have a ballroom with no balls?
Finally they’re opening up the gates

There’ll be actual real live people
It’ll be totally strange
But wow am I so ready for this change

Cuz for the first time in forever
There’ll be music, there’ll be light
For the first time in forever
I’ll be dancing through the night

Don’t know if I’m elated or gassy
But I’m somewhere in that zone
Cuz for the first time in forever
I won’t be alone

For the first time in forever
I’m getting what I’m dreaming of
A chance to change my lonely world 
A chance to find true love

Don’t let them in, don’t let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal
Conceal don’t feel don’t let them know

I know it all ends tomorrow,
So it has to be today
Cuz for the first time in forever
For the first time in forever
Nothing’s | in my way!
