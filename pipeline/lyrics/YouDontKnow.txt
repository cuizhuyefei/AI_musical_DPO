Do you wake up in the morning
And need help to lift your head
Do you read obituaries
And feel jealous of the dead
It's like living on a cliffside
Not knowing when you'll dive
Do you know, Do you know
What it's like to die alive

When a world that once had color
Fades to white and grey and black
When tomorrow terrifies you
But you'll die if you look back

You don't know
I know you don't know
You say that you're hurting
It sure doesn't show
You don't know
It lays me so low
When you say let go
And I say You don't know
