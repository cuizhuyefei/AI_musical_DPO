All these blank and tranquil years
Seems they've dried up all my tears
And while she runs free and fast
Seems my wild days are past

But I miss the mountains
I miss the dizzy heights
All the manic magic days
And the dark depressing nights

I miss the mountains
I miss the highs and lows
All the climbing all the falling
All the while the wild wind blows
Stinging you with snow 
And soaking you with rain
I miss the mountains
I miss the pain
