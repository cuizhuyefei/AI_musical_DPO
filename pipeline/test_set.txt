The sun is shining, it's a lovely day,
A perfect morning for a kid to play,
But you're got lots of bills to pay
What can you do?

Your work real hard and the pay's real low
And every hour goes oh, so slow
And at the end of the day there's no where to go
Back home to Avenue Q

Have you ever felt like nobody was there
Have you ever felt forgotten in the middle of nowhere
Have you ever felt like you could disappear
Like you could fall and no one would hear

Well, let that lonely feeling wash away
Maybe there's a reason to believe you'll be okay
Cause when you don't feel strong enough to stand
You can reach, reach out your hand

Even when the dark comes crashing through
When you need a friend to carry you
And when you're broken on the ground
You will be found

So let the sun come streaming in
Cause you'll reach up and you'll rise again
Lift your head and look around
You will be found

I don't need you to sell me on reasons to want you
I don't need you to search for the proof that I should
You don't have to convince me
You don't have to be scared you're not enough
'Cause what we've got going is good

I don't need more reminders of all that's been broken
I don't need you to fix what I'd rather forget
Clear the slate and start over
Try to quiet the noises in your head
We can't compete with all that

So what if it's us?
What if it's us And only us
And what came before won't count anymore or matter?
Can we try that?

What if it's you
And what if it's me
And what if that's all that we need it to be
And the rest of the world falls away?
What do you say?

I never thought there'd be someone like you who would want me
So I give you ten thousand reasons to not let me go
But if you really see me
If you like me for me and nothing else
Well, that's all that I've wanted for longer that you could possibly know

All these blank and tranquil years
Seems they've dried up all my tears
And while she runs free and fast
Seems my wild days are past

But I miss the mountains
I miss the dizzy heights
All the manic magic days
And the dark depressing nights

I miss the mountains
I miss the highs and lows
All the climbing all the falling
All the while the wild wind blows
Stinging you with snow 
And soaking you with rain
I miss the mountains
I miss the pain

Do you wake up in the morning
And need help to lift your head
Do you read obituaries
And feel jealous of the dead
It's like living on a cliffside
Not knowing when you'll dive
Do you know, Do you know
What it's like to die alive

When a world that once had color
Fades to white and grey and black
When tomorrow terrifies you
But you'll die if you look back

You don't know
I know you don't know
You say that you're hurting
It sure doesn't show
You don't know
It lays me so low
When you say let go
And I say You don't know

Whenever I see someone less fortunate than I
And let's face it
Who isn't less fortunate than I?
My tender heart tends to start to bleed

And when someone needs a makeover
I simply have to take over!
I know, I know exactly what they need!

And even in your case 
Though it's the toughest case I've yet to face
Don't worry, I'm determined to succeed!
Follow my lead

you will be Popular!
You're gonna be popular!
I'll teach you the proper poise
When you talk to boys
Little ways to flirt and flounce

I'll show you what shoes to wear!
How to fix your hair!
Everything that really counts to be... 
POPULAR!
I'll help you be popular!

You'll hang with the right cohorts
You'll be good at sports
Know the slang you've got to know
So let's start
'Cause you've got an awfully long way to go!

Don't be offended by my frank analysis
Think of it as personality dialysis
Now that I've chosen to become a Pal, a sis or an advisor
There's nobody wiser!
Not when it comes to POPULAR!
I know about popular
And with an assist from me
To be who you'll be
Instead of dreary who you were...
There's nothing that can stop you From becoming popu-ler...    

Never again will she get the best of me,
Never again will she take away my freedom,
And we won't forget the day we fought for the right to be a little bit naughty.
Never again, will the chokey door slam.
Never again, will I be bullied and
Never again will I doubt it when my mummy says I'm a miracle.
Never again will we live behind doors

We are revolting children, living in revolting times
We sing revolting songs, using revolting rhymes.
We'll be revolting children til our revoltings done,
And we'll have the Trunchbull bolting, we're REVOLTING!    

He got down on one knee but I said no way
Packed my bags and moved into a nu nu nunneray
Joined the gospel choir, our riffs were on fire
At the top of the charts is where I'm gonna stay

Henry sent me a poem all about my green sleeves
I changed a couple words put it on a sick beat
The song blew their minds, next minute I was signed
And now I'm writing lyrics for Shakesy P

Since my first son, our family's grown
We made a band and got quite well known
You could perhaps call us the Tudor Von Trapps
I'm just kidding, we're called the Royalling Stones

We're one of a kind no category
Too many years lost in his story
We're free to take, our crowning glory
For five more minutes
We're Six

What a shame yeah my face it cost me the crown
So I moved to the Haus of Holbein in my hometown
His mates were super arty, but I showed them how to party
Now on my tour of Prussia everybody gets down

Music man tried it on and I was like bye
So I thought "Who needs him?", I can give it a try
I learned everything, Now all I do is sing
And I'll do that until I die

Heard all about these rockin' chicks
Loved every song and each remix
So I went out and found them, And we lay down an album
Now I don't need your love, all I need is Six    

Step out, step out of the sun
If you keep getting burned
Step out, step out of the sun
Because you've learned, because you've learned

On the outside always looking in
Will I ever be more than I've always been?
'cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass
I'm waving through a window

I try to speak, but nobody can hear
So I wait around for an answer to appear
While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass
I'm waving through a window
Oh, can anybody see,
is anybody waving back at me?

We start with stars in our eyes
We start believing that we belong
But every sun doesn't rise
And no one tells you where you went wrong

When you're falling in a forest
and there's nobody around
Do you ever really crash,
or even make a sound

Hear me now, O thou bleak and unbearable world
Thou art base, and debauched as can be
And a knight, with his banners all bravely unfurled
Now hurls down his gauntlet to thee

I am I, Don Quixote, the Lord of La Mancha
My destiny calls and I go
And the wild winds of fortune, will carry me onward
Oh whithersoever they blow
Whithersoever they blow, onward to glory I go

Hear me heathens and wizards and serpents of sin
All your dastardly doings are past
For a holy endeavor is now to begin
And virtue shall triumph at last

The snow glows white on the mountain tonight, Not a footprint, to be seen
A kingdom of isolation, and it looks like I'm the Queen

The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried

Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl, You always have to be

Conceal don't feel
Don't let them know
Well now they know

Let it go
Let it go
Can't hold it back anymore

I don't care
What they're going to say
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bother me anyway

My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast

The window is open so’s that door
I didn’t know they did that anymore
Who knew we owned eight thousands salad plates?

For years I’ve roamed these empty halls
Why have a ballroom with no balls?
Finally they’re opening up the gates

There’ll be actual real live people
It’ll be totally strange
But wow am I so ready for this change

Cuz for the first time in forever
There’ll be music, there’ll be light
For the first time in forever
I’ll be dancing through the night

Don’t know if I’m elated or gassy
But I’m somewhere in that zone
Cuz for the first time in forever
I won’t be alone

For the first time in forever
I’m getting what I’m dreaming of
A chance to change my lonely world 
A chance to find true love

Don’t let them in, don’t let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal
Conceal don’t feel don’t let them know

I know it all ends tomorrow,
So it has to be today
Cuz for the first time in forever
For the first time in forever
Nothing’s | in my way!

You wait, little girl, on an empty stage, 
For fate to turn the light on
Your life, little girl, is an empty page, 
That men will want to write on

You are sixteen going on seventeen 
Baby, it's time to think
Better beware, be canny and careful 
Baby, you're on the brink

You are sixteen going on seventeen 
Fellows will fall in line
Eager young lads and rogues and cads 
Will offer you food and wine

Totally unprepared are you 
To face a world of men
Timid and shy and scared are you 
Of things beyond your ken

To dream the impossible dream,
To fight the unbeatable foe,
To bear with unbearable sorrow
To run where the brave dare not go;

To right the unrightable wrong.
To love, pure and chaste, from afar,
To try, when your arms are too weary,
To reach the unreachable star!

This is my Quest to follow that star,
No matter how hopeless, no matter how far,

To fight for the right
Without question or pause,
To be willing to march into hell
For a heavenly cause!

And I know, if I'll only be true
To this glorious Quest,
That my heart will lie peaceful and calm
When I'm laid to my rest.

And the world will be better for this,
That one man, scorned and covered with scars,

Still strove, with his last ounce of courage,
To reach the unreachable stars!

And I got my first job flying for a mortician
in a tiny bonanza, just a corpse and me
Five dollars an hour for flying dead bodies
I had to climb over their faces just to get to my seat

And suddenly the wheels lift off
the ground is falling backwards
I am suddenly alive

Suddenly I'm in the cockpit
Suddenly everything's changed
Suddenly I'm not too young or too short
and the passengers in the back don't complain

Suddenly I'm flying company charters
Suddenly everything's high
Suddenly there's nothing in between me and the sky

Welcome to the show to the historemix
Switching up the flow as we add the prefix
Everybody knows that we used to be six wives

Raising up the roof till we hit the ceiling
Get ready for the truth that we'll be revealing
Everybody knows that we used to be six wives
But now we're Ex-wives.

All you ever hear and read about
Is our ex, and the way it ended
But a pair doesn't beat a royal flush
You're gonna find out how we got unfriended

Tonight, we're gonna do ourselves justice,
cause we're taking you to court
And every Tudor rose has it's thorns
and you're gonna hear them live in consort.

In sleep he sang to me
In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me
And speaks my name

And do I dream again
For now I find
The phantom of the opera is there
Inside my mind

Sing once again with me
Our strange duet
My power over you
Grows stronger yet

When I grow up,
I will be brave enough to fight the creatures
That you have to fight beneath the bed each night to be a grown up.

Just because you find that life's not fair, 
it doesn't mean that you just have to grin and bear it!
If you always take it on the chin and wear it
Nothing will change.

Just because I find myself in this story,
It doesn't mean that everything is written for me.
If I think the ending is fixed already,
I might as well be saying 
I think that it's OK,
And that's not right!

In the eye of a hurricane 
there is quiet
For just a moment
A yellow sky

When I was seventeen a hurricane 
destroyed my town
I didn’t drown
I couldn’t seem to die

I wrote my way out
Wrote everything down far as I could see
I wrote my way out
I looked up and the town had its eyes on me

They passed a plate around
Total strangers
Moved to kindness by my story
Raised enough for me to book passage on a
Ship that was New York bound…

I wrote my way out of hell
I wrote my way to revolution
I was louder than the crack in the bell
I wrote Eliza love letters until she fell
I wrote about The Constitution and defended it well
And in the face of ignorance and resistance
I wrote financial systems into existence
And when my prayers to God were met with indifference
I picked up a pen, I wrote my own deliverance

My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher
But there are things that the Homilies and hymns won't teach ya
My mother was a genius
My father commanded respect
When they died they left no instructions
Just a legacy to protect

Death doesn’t discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall And we break
And we make our mistakes

And if there’s a reason I’m still alive
When everyone who loves me has died
I’m willing to wait for it
I’m willing to wait for it

Wait for it
I am the one thing in life I can control
I am inimitable
I am an original
I’m not falling behind or running late
I’m not standing still
I am lying in wait

Hamilton faces an endless uphill climb
He has something to prove
He has nothing to lose
Hamilton’s pace is relentless
He wastes no time
What is it like in his shoes?
